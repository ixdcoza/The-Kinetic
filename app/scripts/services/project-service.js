              description: "<p>For the last 2 years Anglo American has held a global conference to bring together the marketing heads of all the wings in the organisation, aiming to consolidate and strategise a holistic strategy for the year to come. This year Cape Town was selected as the Venue and The Kinetic was brought on board to produce all the digital assets for the conference. Aiming to modernize the company, one of the key areas was the incorporation of an Ipad app rather than having a traditional printed conference program.</p> <p>Further more the delivery included a website for the conference, invitational emails sent out bi-weekly which each included a 1 minute video trailer to the event. The videosâ€™ narratives were linked and built from one to the next. The culmination video including all the teasers along with a resolution message was screened at the conference opening along with on-screen content loops which ran throughout the conference.</p>",

L'Amande is not colour specific; it blends with each flavour creating an array of flavours and textures to work with and be inspired by. The hand drawn logo combined with crisp, slick design captures the experience of a macaron with its crisp outer shell and gooey filling. L'Amande de Macaron is not just about baking, but about all the flavours of life and the branding serves as a foretaste for this. L'Amande is all for the melting, immaculate, tasty almond perfection that is a Macaron.</p>",

Our main working concept was to bring the brand back to a point where the channels focus was its content. Users know and understand that the channel broadcasts premier television content, and we wanted to focus on that fact. The channel should amplify the content, and through that, itself.</p><p>The channel pay-off line was tweaked to 'Your magic begins here', and this was initiated by the fact that the best content is hosted on the M-Net and is the first channel in the satellite bouquet. This tied into the historic usage of the word 'magic' in M-Net's brand communication and how creating television magic has become synonymous with the viewing public in South Africa.</p><p>Utilising 2 simple and sleek treatment options, we focused on highlighting the world class content and presenting the viewer with a channel they can immediately recognise as M-Net.</p>",
